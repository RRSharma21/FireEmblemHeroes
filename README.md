# FireEmblemHeroes
Recreating Nintendo's Fire Emblem Heroes website with the addition of database containing information on the various
characters in the game. 
Current progress as of thus far: http://scs.ryerson.ca/~rrsharma/FEHeroes/index.html   
- Clicking on the bottom left image plays the trailer, whereas clicking the bottom right image takes you to the official website.  
This site is a fan based project, I do not own any of the images used. Fire Emblem is owned by Nintendo, and Shouzou Kaga. Please support the official release.
